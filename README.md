# Testa

## What this is
This is the backend for our new project Idealisk, it takes an image and outputs the data it was able to gather from the image

## How to start
You need pipenv to get started, it also uses opencv so we recomend Python 3.7

To get started run
```
git clone https://github.com/Katraines/testa
py -m pip install pipenv
py -m pipenv install
py -m pipenv run flask run -p 80
```

## What we learned
+ Pipenv & Venv
+ OpenCV & Tensorflow
